    Hello, welcome to my portfolio page.
    <br /> <br /> I've called my website mr-monkey, because my girlfriend calls
    me Mr. Monkey. She calls me that because she thinks I'm curious and active,
    just like a monkey. <br /> <br /> Well, as web developer, I am indeed
    actively coding and am very curious about learning programming languages.
    I'm fascinated by the creativity and dynamic of web development.
    <br />
    <br /> I wish you a good journey in my page.
